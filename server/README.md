# WORK IN PROGRESS

Spudify Backend (using LHL Node Skeleton)
=========

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Creating The DB

Use the `psql -U development` command to login to the PostgreSQL server with the username `development` and the password `development`. This command **MUST** be run in a vagrant terminal, we are using the PostgreSQL installation provided in the vagrant environment.

Create a database with the command `CREATE DATABASE spudify;`.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.development` and fill in the necessary PostgreSQL configuration. The `node-postgres` library uses these environment variables by default.

```
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=development
PGDATABASE=scheduler_development
PGPASSWORD=development
PGPORT=5432
```

## Seeding

Run a the development server with `npm start` in the Host environment. We are only using vagrant for `psql` this week.

Both of these achieve the same result.

- Make a `GET` request to `/api/debug/reset` with `curl http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`.
- Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`.

The `development` data is random. Each time we seed we expect to see different appointments.

## Run The Server

Running the server normally
```sh
npm start
```

Running the server so it returns an error when saving/deleting for testing the client's error handling capabilities
```sh
npm run error
```

## Setup

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `development` 
  - password: `development` 
  - database: `spudify`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
5. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
- NPM 5.x or above
- PG 6.x
